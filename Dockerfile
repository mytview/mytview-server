# PINNED to an exact Node release — never a floating major tag. 2026-08-08: a routine CI rebuild
# pulled the freshly-rolled node:24-trixie (Node 24.19.0, released 08-03) and the server crash-looped
# with a native abort in better-sqlite3's statement finalizer (`RemoveEnvironmentCleanupHook:
# Assertion failed: (env) != nullptr`) — no JS stack, nothing to catch. Same ABI (137), so the
# binding loads and then dies. A base-image bump must be a DELIBERATE, tested change (edit both
# stages together + verify boot against a populated /data), not a side effect of rebuilding.

# Trixie (Debian 13), NOT bookworm: the bundled iHD VA driver must be recent enough to init
# the host's iGPU. bookworm ships iHD ~23.x, which fails to initialise newer/edge-kernel iGPUs
# (e.g. Alder Lake-N, which needs i915.force_probe) with an "Input/output error"; trixie ships
# iHD ~25.x — the same driver a working Plex LXC uses on the same hosts. The container carries
# its own VA driver, so this is independent of whatever the PVE host has installed.

# drivers for TRANSCODE_HWACCEL=1 + /dev/dri: intel-media-va-driver (iHD) is what modern
# Intel iGPUs (Gen8+) need — mesa's VAAPI is AMD-only; i965 covers legacy Intel. iHD is in
# non-free, added by appending the component to the existing deb822 source (a separate .list
# clashes with its Signed-By keyring). All idle on the default CPU (libx264) path.
# vainfo is bundled so the container's *own* VA stack can be checked directly (the LXC/host
# driver is irrelevant — the container carries its own): `docker exec mytview vainfo`
# should show `va_openDriver() returns 0` and an iHD ~25.x, else HW transcode falls back to CPU.

# The Intel iGPU drivers (iHD/i965) are x86-only Debian packages, so they're installed on amd64
# and skipped on other arches (arm64 has no Intel VAAPI — it uses the CPU libx264 path). This
# keeps the image buildable as a multi-arch manifest (amd64 + arm64) without failing apt on ARM.
# TARGETARCH is set automatically by buildx per platform.
