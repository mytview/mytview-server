# MytView Server

> *Say it "mighty view" — and the first four letters are **MyTV**.*

**A clean, fast, read-only viewer for a self-hosted video library** — video files plus their
metadata sidecars (`.info.json`, or Kodi/Emby-style `.nfo` for TV series and movies) — with
multi-user accounts, per-user watch state, owner-controlled per-channel privacy, public share
links, server-to-server federation, two-way Plex watch-state sync, and live HLS transcoding when
a client can't play a file directly.

Run it on your own hardware (NAS, home server, mini-PC) and watch in any browser — or with the
native **iPhone / iPad / Apple TV**, **Google TV**, and **Samsung TV (Tizen)** apps, which talk to
this server over its [documented API](docs/api.md).

- 🔒 **Private by design** — no cloud, no analytics, no ads. Streams go straight from your server to your device.
- 📚 **Read-only** — your library is mounted `:ro`; MytView never writes to, moves, or deletes your files.
- 👥 **Multi-user** — per-person sign-in, watch state, and resume points. Invite-based signup; the owner can reset passwords, deactivate, or remove accounts. Per-device session management with server-side revocation.
- 🔦 **Per-channel privacy** — mark channels public or private and grant private ones to specific people, from a per-user × per-channel grid.
- 📺 **Channels, series, and movies** — creator-channel libraries (`.info.json` sidecars), TV-series libraries (`.nfo` + `S01E02` naming, season/episode ordering, next-episode tracking), and movie libraries (the Kodi layout media managers write, a 2:3 poster wall with genre filters and sort). Libraries are configured in the UI, not env vars; fully-watched shows tidy themselves out of the grids until something new arrives.
- 🎞️ **Direct-play first, live HLS fallback** — every client tries the original file first; when it can't decode it, the server live-transcodes an ephemeral HLS stream that starts in seconds (VAAPI hardware encode when available, CPU fallback). Nothing is pre-transcoded or stored long-term.
- 💬 **Subtitles & captions** — picked up from `.srt`/`.vtt` files next to the video *or* from text tracks inside the `.mkv`/`.mp4` itself, with SDH/CC marked as captions. Nothing is downloaded: what's on disk is what you get. **Image-based subtitles (PGS/VobSub) are not supported** — they're pictures of text and would need OCR or a burned-in re-encode; use a text (SRT) version instead.
- 🔗 **Share links** — per-video public links with expiry and view caps, link-preview cards, and the same live-HLS fallback for recipients.
- 🌐 **Federation** — peer with **any number** of other MytView servers, sharing and consuming in both directions. Share different channels, shows, or whole libraries with each household; everything you consume merges into your own libraries (browse, search, and watch state stay on *your* server) while video streams flow **directly** from whichever server holds the file — plus per-peer concurrent-stream caps and consumption stats for the sharer.
- 📲 **Offline on the phone** — the iPhone/iPad app (Android in open testing) keeps movies and episodes on the device and follows a series for the next unwatched ones; the server hands out each copy in the format the device plays (H.264 and HEVC MKVs are remuxed, not re-encoded), paced by a negotiated session budget so a batch never crowds out someone watching live.
- 🔄 **Plex sync** — two-way watched-state and resume-point sync with a Plex server on the same library. Each user links their own Plex account (plex.tv PIN flow); years of existing Plex history import on the first sync, and an unwatch in either app propagates to the other.

## Quick start (Docker)

**Unraid:** install from Community Applications (search `MytView`); the template lives at
https://github.com/mytview/unraid-templates. Everything else: the compose file below.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mytview:
    image: fbartolini/mytview:latest
    container_name: mytview
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8700:8700"
    environment:
      ALLOW_SIGNUP: invite            # first account becomes the owner
      # ORIGIN: https://mytview.example.com     # only behind a reverse proxy / TLS
      # ADDRESS_HEADER: x-forwarded-for         # only behind a reverse proxy / CDN
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/library:/media:ro   # your video library — READ-ONLY
      - mytview-data:/data                # accounts + watch state + index (back this up)
      - /path/to/scratch:/transcodes      # writable scratch for live-HLS segments
volumes:
  mytview-data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://your-host:8700** and **sign up** — the first account bootstraps the owner. After
that, signup requires a single-use invite (from `/invite`) unless `ALLOW_SIGNUP=all`.

## Configuration

### Volumes
| Container path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/media` | Your video library | Mount **read-only** (`:ro`). MytView never modifies it. |
| `/data` | Accounts, sessions, watch state + the search index | **Durable — back this up.** The index rebuilds from disk; your users/progress do not. |
| `/transcodes` | Scratch space for live-HLS segments | Segments exist only while someone is watching and are cleaned up after. Keep it outside your library. |

### Environment
| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALLOW_SIGNUP` | `invite` | `invite` (first account = owner, then invite-only), `all`, or `off`. |
| `ALLOW_INVITES` | `owner` | Who may create invite links: `owner` or `all`. |
| `ORIGIN` | — | Your external URL — set **only** behind a reverse proxy / TLS. Leave it unset otherwise (from 0.4.10 a blank value counts as unset; older images refuse to start on a blank `ORIGIN`). |
| `ADDRESS_HEADER` | — | Behind a proxy/CDN, the header carrying the real client IP (e.g. `x-forwarded-for`), so login rate limits see clients rather than the proxy. |
| `TRANSCODE_HWACCEL` | `0` | `1` = Intel VAAPI hardware encode for live HLS (needs `/dev/dri` passthrough; amd64). Falls back to CPU automatically. |
| `EMBEDDED_SUBS` | `1` | `off` stops the server reading subtitle tracks out of `.mkv`/`.mp4` containers (sidecar `.srt`/`.vtt` files still work). Extraction reads the whole container once per file, so on slow network storage turning it off is a reasonable choice. |
| `SUBS_CACHE_DIR` | `/transcodes/subcache` | Where extracted subtitle text is cached, so a container is only ever read once. `off` = memory only. |
| `HLS_DIR` | `/transcodes/hls` | Where live-HLS session segments are written. `off` disables live transcoding (direct-play only). |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL` | `5` | Auto-rescan interval in minutes (`0` disables). Incremental and cheap. |
| `EXTERNAL_URL` | — | The public address federation invites embed — needed only to **share** via federation and only when the auto-detected address is wrong (e.g. a bare `ip:port` server without TLS). |

Federation and Plex sync are configured **in the app**, not the environment: pairing, library
mappings, sync cadence, and per-peer stream caps live on the owner pages; what gets shared is
picked on the Sharing page; each user links Plex from their own Account page.

Baked into the image (override only if you must): `PORT=8700`, `HOST=0.0.0.0`,
`MEDIA_ROOT=/media`, `DB_PATH=/data/index.db`, `TRANSCODE_DIR=/transcodes`.

### Hardware transcoding (amd64 + Intel iGPU)
The repo ships [`docker-compose.hwaccel.yml`](docker-compose.hwaccel.yml) as a merge-in
override, so the base compose stays runnable on hosts without a GPU:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.hwaccel.yml up -d
```

(Equivalent by hand: `TRANSCODE_HWACCEL: "1"` plus `devices: [/dev/dri:/dev/dri]`.)

### Reverse proxies and Cloudflare

MytView is plain HTTP: no WebSockets, no server-sent events, so any reverse proxy works with
its defaults, plus two things worth knowing:

- **Read timeout for `/hls/`**: at least 60 s. A download's playlist can wait 20 s on a file's
  one-time keyframe scan, and a segment up to 45 s on a slow encode; a proxy that gives up sooner
  turns those into 502/504s the apps read as "server busy".
- **Cloudflare**: a proxied (orange-cloud) hostname works; the demo server runs that way. What
  breaks the apps is bot protection that challenges non-browser clients, which answers **403** to
  the app while Safari and Chrome pass: **Security → Bots → Bot Fight Mode** (the Free-plan one
  cannot be exempted per hostname or path), a WAF managed or custom rule with a challenge action,
  or Security Level "I'm Under Attack". Turn the one that is on off for the zone, or on a paid plan
  tune Super Bot Fight Mode to allow that hostname; everything else about the proxy can stay.
- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: an Access List other than "Publicly Accessible" answers 403 to the apps
  (they send no basic auth and may be on cellular). "Block Common Exploits" and "Websockets
  Support" are harmless either way.

A quick check from any machine: `curl -i -X POST https://your-host/api/v1/auth/login -H
'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"x","password":"y"}'` should answer **401**
(bad credentials). A 403 there is the proxy layer, not MytView.

## Library layout

Two library formats, configured by the owner in the UI (**Libraries** in the avatar menu) —
any subfolder of `/media` can be its own library:

- **Channels** — `Channel Name/…/Video Title.mp4` + a sibling `Video Title.info.json`
  (title, date, description, tags, thumbnail…). Channels are keyed by their top-level folder.
- **Series** — `Show Name/Season 1/Show - S01E02 - Title.mkv` with Kodi/Emby `.nfo` sidecars
  and local artwork (`poster.jpg`, `fanart.jpg`, `-thumb.jpg`), the layout media managers write.
  Falls back to `SxxExx` filename parsing when no `.nfo` exists.

- **Movies** — `Movie Name (2024)/Movie Name (2024).mkv` with `movie.nfo` + `poster.jpg`/
  `fanart.jpg` (the Kodi layout media managers write). Rendered as a poster wall with genre filters and
  title/year/recently-added sorting.

**Creator archives that look like TV shows.** Some download tools present a creator's channel as a
show (`Show/Season 2021/s2021.e031701 - Title.mp4`) and write both yt-dlp's `.info.json` sidecar and
a Jellyfin/Kodi `.nfo`. Either library type handles that folder: MytView reads the `.info.json` and
indexes it as a channel (real titles, upload dates, descriptions, tags), with the same video ids in
a Channels or a Series library, so watch state survives if you switch. A show with `.nfo` files only
and date-coded episode numbers is shown by date rather than as "S2021 E31701".

Libraries are explicit: with none configured, nothing is indexed and the first-run screen walks
the owner through adding one (any subfolder — or the root — per library).

## Federation (share with another household)

A MytView server can peer with **as many other servers as you like**, sharing to some and
consuming from others (or both with the same peer). Pairing is per-peer: one owner mints a
single-use invite, the other pastes it. The sharer then picks channels/shows/libraries **per
peer** on the Sharing page — each federated server appears as one more column next to your
users, and a whole-library share covers future content automatically. The consumer maps each
shared library into one of their own — or a new virtual library, and several peers' libraries
can merge into the same one — with the same feed, search, tags, and per-user watch state, all
served by the consumer's server. **Media never relays**: playback streams
directly from the sharing server to the viewer's device via short-lived signed URLs, so a slow
home uplink is never in the middle. Duplicate items (the same movie on both servers) collapse
automatically — the local copy wins.

## Plex sync

If a Plex Media Server serves the same files, MytView keeps watch state agreed both ways:
watched flags and resume positions sync per user, in both directions, every few minutes. Items
pair by tmdb/imdb/tvdb ids with a file-path fallback; the first sync imports existing Plex
history without un-watching anything. Setup: the owner sets the Plex address on their Account
page; each user links their own Plex account there via plex.tv/link.

## Clients & API

The web UI ships with the server. The native apps (iPhone/iPad/Apple TV, Google TV,
Samsung TV) are separate, closed-source products by the same author — the Samsung app is free.

They are free today and become a small one-time purchase (no subscription) from 1 November 2026.
**Install an app before 1 November 2026 and it stays free forever** — a founder licence, detected
from the install date itself, with nothing to claim or register.

**Get the apps:**

- **iPhone / iPad / Apple TV**: [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6790113115) — iPhone
  and iPad 1.2 with offline downloads, Apple TV 1.1
- **Android phone / tablet / Google TV**: [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytview.app)
  as an open beta, no invite needed (offline downloads are in testing and follow in the next release)
- **Samsung TV**: free for everyone, lands on the Samsung store when Samsung's review completes —
  [watch releases](https://github.com/mytview/mytview-server/releases) for the announcement. Until
  then, as a temporary workaround, the app can be [built from source and sideloaded](https://github.com/mytview/mytview-tizen)
  onto your own TV with Samsung's free developer tools.

Third-party clients are welcome: the full client contract — auth and device pairing, the
video/playback descriptors, watch-state rules, and the capabilities negotiation — is documented
in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md). `GET /api/v1/status` advertises `serverVersion` and a
`capabilities` list to feature-gate against.

## Development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # set MEDIA_ROOT to a local path
npm run dev             # Vite dev server
npm run check           # svelte-check — must stay clean
npm test                # vitest suite
npm run build && node build   # production build (adapter-node)
```

Runtime dependencies are deliberately minimal: SvelteKit + `better-sqlite3` (+ `hls.js` on the
web player). Transcoding shells out to `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` (bundled in the Docker image). Two
SQLite databases live in `/data`: `index.db` (disposable cache, rebuilt by scanning) and
`state.db` (durable: users, sessions, watch state — the only thing worth backing up).

## How it is built

MytView is a solo project, proudly co-created with Anthropic's Claude (Opus and Fable) under my
direction: the design, the product decisions, the review and the field testing are mine, and every
increment ships with tests and runs on my own servers before it is released. It is 2026; get over it.
Opinions on the tooling are not sought here and will not be engaged with. Bug reports and pull
requests about what the software does are very welcome.
